              <strong>Cleansing agents:</strong> These are surfactants that help

              cleansing agents include sulphate (like SLS, SLES).

            <li>
              <strong>Surfactants:</strong> These substances reduce the surface

              <strong>Other ingredients:</strong> These ingredients may be added
              to face washes to provide additional benefits or brighten the
              skin. Common other ingredients include glycerine, hyaluronic acid,
              salicylic acid, and vitamin C.

            <li>
              <strong>Cleansing agents:</strong> Cleansing agents are typically
              surfactants that have a hydrophilic (water-loving) head and a
              hydrophobic (oil-loving) tail. This allows them to break down and
              remove oil and dirt from the skin.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Surfactants:</strong> Surfactants are similar to cleansing
              agents in that they have a hydrophilic head and a hydrophobic
              tail. However, surfactants are typically used at lower
              concentrations than cleansing agents.
